The following variables are found in the raw data (https://github.com/alecristia/phr-V-AnotB-VRM-longi/blob/master/Longitudinal_8_22_16.csv) and may be used in the analysis scripts:

Subject # (Subject.. inside R): random child ID
Gender: F if child is female, M if male
18mCDIAge (X18mCDIAge inside R): Age at which 18mo CDI was collected
18mCom (X18mCom inside R): Raw receptive score for 18mo CDI	
18mComAll (X18mComAll inside R): 	
18mComGenderSpec (X18mComGenderSpec inside R): Percentile adjusting for age & gender for receptive score for 18mo CDI
18mSay (X18mSay inside R): Raw expressive score for 18mo CDI	
18mSayAll (X18mSayAll inside R):	
18mSayGenderSpec (X18mSayGenderSpec inside R): Percentile adjusting for age & gender for expressive score for 18mo CDI	
24mCDIAge (X24mCDIAge inside R): Age at which 24mo CDI was collected	
24mCom (X24mCom inside R): Raw receptive score for 24mo CDI - discarded early on because it is not typically part of the 24m instrument
24msay	 (X24msay inside R): Raw expressive score for 24mo CDI
24mSayALL (X24mSayALL inside R)	
24mSayGenderSpec (X24mSayGenderSpec inside R): Percentile adjusting for age & gender expressive score for 24mo CDI	
Mullen VR (Mullen.VR inside R):	
MullenExL:	
stress & VRM age (stress...VRM.age inside R): age at which stress & vrm tasks were collected	
total tro pref quotient	(total.tro.pref.quotient inside R): performance in the stress task
VRM trials completed (VRM.trials.completed inside R):	number of vrm trials completed
VRM trials coded (VRM.trials.coded inside R): number of vrm trials coded
VRM age	(VRM.age inside R): age at which vrm task was collected
Novelty VRM (Novelty.VRM inside R): performance in VRM task (preference quotient) 
faces VRM (faces.VRM inside R):	score for VRM for the faces problems only
Shapes VRM (Shapes.VRM inside R): score for VRM for the shapes problems only	
vowels Age (vowels.Age inside R): age at which vowel task was collected	
Vowel Alt pref quotient	(Vowel.Alt.pref.quotient inside R): performance in vowel task (preference quotient)
A not B Age (A.not.B.Age inside R): age at which a not b was collected (typically equal to vowels.Age but sometimes up to a week later)
A not B score (A.not.B.score inside R): score in as classified into numeric (uninterpretable) terms	
notes1: notes at the individual child level	
notes2: general notes

The following variables are NOT found in the raw data, but instead are generated within the analysis scripts:
com18z: z-scored raw receptive vocabulary at 18m
say18z: z-scored raw expressive vocabulary at 18m
say24z: z-scored raw expressive vocabulary at 24m
anotB: a not b performance as classified into three interpretable terms
Stress: performance in stress task (preference quotient) = total.tro.pref.quotient
VRM: performance in VRM task (preference quotient) = Novelty.VRM
Vowel: performance in vowel task (preference quotient) = Vowel.Alt.pref.quotient
